    instruction: |
      Implement the following feature:
      1. Create a new file `output/sample.py`
      2. Add a function that returns "Hello, World!"
    validation:
      - "`output/sample.py` exists"
      - "Function `hello()` is defined"
      - "Running `python output/sample.py` outputs 'Hello, World!'"

  - id: task_2
    name: Sample Task 2
    depends_on: [task_1]
    instruction: |
      Extend the previous implementation:
      1. Add a second function `goodbye()` that returns "Goodbye!"
    validation:
      - "Function `goodbye()` is defined in `output/sample.py`"
      - "Both functions work correctly"
